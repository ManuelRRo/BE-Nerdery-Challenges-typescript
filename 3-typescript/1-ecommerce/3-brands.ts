/**
 *  Challenge 4: Get Countries with Brands and Amount of Products
 *
 * Create a function that takes an array of brands and products, and returns the countries with the amount of products available in each country.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * - The function should accept an array of Brand objects and an array of Product objects.
 * - Each brand should have a country property.
 * - Each product should have a brandId property that corresponds to the id of a brand.
 * - The function should return an array of objects, each containing a country and the amount of products available in that country.
 * - The amount of products should be calculated by counting the number of products that have a brandId matching the id of a brand in the same country.
 * - The return should be a type that allow us to define the country name as a key and the amount of products as a value.
