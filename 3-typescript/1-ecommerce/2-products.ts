 * Products - Challenge 1: Product Price Analysis
 *
 * Create a function that analyzes pricing information from an array of products.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * - Create a function called `analyzeProductPrices` that accepts an array of Product objects
 * - The function should return an object containing:
 *   - totalPrice: The sum of all product prices
 *   - averagePrice: The average price of all products (rounded to 2 decimal places)
 *   - mostExpensiveProduct: The complete Product object with the highest price
 *   - cheapestProduct: The complete Product object with the lowest price
 *   - onSaleCount: The number of products that are currently on sale
 *   - averageDiscount: The average discount percentage for products on sale (rounded to 2 decimal places)
 * - Prices should be manage in regular prices and not in sale prices
 * - Use proper TypeScript typing for parameters and return values
 * - Implement the function using efficient array methods
 *
